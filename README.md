4) Length of the Linked List
5) Displaying the List
6) Deleting Nodes in the list( Beginning, End and Middle) 
7) Deleting the whole list   

Note: The above operation's implementation is in file "linkedlist.cpp"

8) Swapping two adjacent nodes in a single linked list

Note: The above operation's implementaion is in file "swaplist.cpp"

9) Reversing elements in the Single Linked List
